            A Membership Table implementation using Apache Zookeeper 3.4.6 https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.4.6/
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            A brief overview of ZK features used: The data is represented by a tree of nodes (similar to a file system). 
            Every node is addressed by a path and can hold data as a byte array and has a version. When a node is created, 
            its version is 0. Upon updates, the version is atomically incremented. An update can also be conditional on an 
            expected current version. A transaction can hold several operations, which succeed or fail atomically.
            when creating a zookeeper client, one can set a base path where all operations are relative to.
            
            In this implementation:
            Every Orleans deployment has a node   /UniqueDeploymentId
            Every Silo's state is saved in        /UniqueDeploymentId/IP:Port@Gen
            Every Silo's IAmAlive is saved in     /UniqueDeploymentId/IP:Port@Gen/IAmAlive
            IAmAlive is saved in a separate node because its updates are unconditional.
            
            a node's ZK version is its ETag:
            the table version is the version of /UniqueDeploymentId
            the silo entry version is the version of /UniqueDeploymentId/IP:Port@Gen

            This operation should only update the IAmAlive column and not change other columns.
            This operation is a "dirty write" or "in place update" and is performed without etag validation. 
            With regards to eTags update:
            This operation may automatically update the eTag associated with the given silo row, but it does not have to. It can also leave the etag not changed ("dirty write").
            With regards to TableVersion:
            this operation should not change the TableVersion of the table. It should leave it untouched.
            There is no scenario where this operation could fail due to table semantical reasons. It can only fail due to network problems or table unavailability.
